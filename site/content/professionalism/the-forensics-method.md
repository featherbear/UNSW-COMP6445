## Forensic Soundness

* Defensible
* Repeatable

## What about when things aren't forensically sound?

* What if you can't use a write blocker?
* What if access is time constrained?
* What if the computer is off

> Even if the evidence can only be collected (with modifications), it is still admissible provided it is documented and logical

***

## Handling Digital Evidence

* Follow all general forensics and procedural principles
  * e.g. Be invited into the case
* Actions taken to obtain evidence should not change the evidence
* All activity relating to the seizure, access, storage or transfer of evidence must be documented
* An individual is responsible for all actions taken whilst digital evidence is in their possession?
