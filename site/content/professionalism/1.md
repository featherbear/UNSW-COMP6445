# Soundness

> Digital evidence is said to be **forensically sound** if it was collected, analysed, handled and stored in a manner that is acceptable by the law, and there is reasonable evidence to prove so. Forensic soundness gives reasonable assurance that digital evidence was not corrupted or destroyed during investigative processes whether on purpose or by accident.
